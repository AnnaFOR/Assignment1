        <p>
            Perhaps, one of <strong>the most beautiful</strong> poems written in human history. 
            <br>An allegory about the meaning of life...

            As you set out for Ithaca<br>
            hope your road is a long one,<br>
            full of adventure, full of discovery.<br>
            Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
            angry Poseidon -don't be afraid of them:<br>
            you'll never find things like that on your way<br>
            as long as you keep your thoughts raised high,<br>
            as long as a rare excitement<br>
            stirs your spirit and your body.<br>
            Laistrygonians, Cyclops,<br>
            wild Poseidon -you won't encounter them<br>
            unless you bring them along inside your soul,<br>
            unless your soul sets them up in front of you.<br>
            <br>
            Hope your road is a long one.<br>
            May there be many summer mornings when,<br>
            with what pleasure, what joy,<br>
            you enter harbors you're seeing for the fist time;<br>
            may you stop at Phoenician trading stations<br>
            to buy fine things,<br>
            mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony,<br>
            sensual perfume of every kind-<br>
            as many sensual perfumes as you can;<br>
            and may you visit many Egyptian cities<br>
            to lear and go on learning from their scholars.<br>
            <br>
            Keep Ithaca always in your mind.<br>
            Arriving there is what you're destined for.<br>
            But don't hurry the journey at all.<br>
            Better if it lasts for years,<br>
            so you're old by the time you reach the island,<br>
            wealthy with all you've gained on the way,<br>
            not expecting Ithaca to make you rich.<br>
            <br>
            Ithaca gave you the marvelous journey.<br>
            Without her you wouldn't have set out.<br>
            She has nothing left to give you now.<br>
            <br>
            And if you find her poor, Ithaca won't have fooled you.<br>
            Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,<br>
            you'll have understood by then what these Ithacas mean.
